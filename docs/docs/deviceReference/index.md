# Devices

This is the device reference. Here you can find anything you need to create your own devices.

Devices are an essential part of taskZen. They define the capabilities of your script. Devices are shared between all scripts using the same device and thus all scripts with the same device only need to initialize once. Devices are `.yaml` files located in the `~/.config/taskZen/devices/` directory.

You can either [create your own device](../createYourOwn/) or use one of the [built-in devices](../builtIn/).
