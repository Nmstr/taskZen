# Built-in Devices

There are currently 2 built in devices. `taskZen-minimal` and `taskZen-extra`. The `taskZen-minimal` device is a very minimal device for when your script only needs common keys and buttons. The `taskZen-extra` device is a more advanced device that includes more keys and buttons. Both devices can be found in the `~/.config/taskZen/devices/` directory.
