# Scripts

This is the script reference. Here you can find anything you need to create your own scripts.

Scripts are the most important part of taskZen. They define instruction which can then be executed. They consist of 2 parts: the [header](https://nmstr.github.io/taskZen/scriptReference/header/) and the [body](https://nmstr.github.io/taskZen/scriptReference/body/). Scripts are `.yaml` files located in the `~/.config/taskZen/scripts/` directory.
