The Homepage is the landing page of the GUI. It serves as the main menu. It allows you to:

1. **View and Edit Scripts**: On the left side, you can see all your scripts. Simply click on any script to open it in the [editor](https://nmstr.github.io/taskZen/guiReference/scriptEditor/). You can also create a new script by clicking the "Create Script" button at the top of the page.

2. **Manage Devices**: Currently, devices are not yet implemented. However, this feature will be implemented in the near future.
